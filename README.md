The problem it solves--

Targeting problems like environmental pollution, illegal and untreated waste disposal, and corruption in environmental bodies:-

WE HAVE MADE A BLOCKCHAIN-BASED WEB APPLICATION THAT CAN, MONITOR THE WASTE DISPOSED OF BY THE REGISTERED FACTORIES AND INDUSTRIES ON THE APPLICATION, INVOLVE NGOS IN THE PROCESS OF INSPECTION, PROCEED ON GENERAL PUBLICâ€™S COMPLAINTS ON THESE ISSUES, AND HAVE A MONITORING HEAD THAT COULD SURVEIL THE WHOLE PROCESS.

The Problem it solves:-
-Removes unethical and illegal practices by industries.
-Removes unethical indulgence of Government officials with these malpractice institutions.
-Involving NGOs to reduce corruption.
